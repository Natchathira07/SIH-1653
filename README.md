## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Team Collaboration & Project Management

## Problem Description
In large-scale events like the Smart India Hackathon (SIH), effective team collaboration and project management are essential for success. However, many teams struggle with communication, task distribution, time management, and decision-making, which can lead to inefficiencies, missed deadlines, and incomplete projects.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Ministry of Defence

## Idea
1.Define Clear Roles & Responsibilities: Assign specific roles to each team member (Team Lead, Developer, Designer, Researcher, Presenter, etc.).
Use the RACI Matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) to clarify roles.

2.Use Agile Methodologies: Follow the Scrum framework with daily stand-up meetings (15-minute updates on progress).
Use Kanban boards (Trello, Jira) to track tasks visually.
Divide the project into sprints (short, focused work cycles)

3.Effective Communication & Collaboration Tools: Use Slack, Discord, or Microsoft Teams for real-time discussions.
Document project details in Notion, Confluence, or Google Docs.

4.Smart Task Management & Prioritization: Urgent & Important – Do immediately
                                          Important but Not Urgent – Schedule for later
                                          Urgent but Not Important – Delegate
                                          Neither Urgent nor Important – Avoid

5.Post-Project Documentation & Knowledge Sharing: Maintain a project wiki for future reference.
                                                  Conduct "Lessons Learned" sessions after each project.
                                                  Share insights and best practices through blogs or presentations.
